# Project-Godot-3d-Pixel-Art
 3D pixel art, or voxel art, blends retro 2D pixel aesthetics with 3D modeling. Using cube-shaped voxels, it creates blocky, low-res 3D models reminiscent of early video games. Voxels form structures, characters, and environments in a grid system, offering a nostalgic yet modern style for games and art. (349 characters).
